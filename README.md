## üîß HOW TO USE

In this section you will find a quick guide on how to use this action.

### ‚úîÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before you run into issues with your deployment, here are a few steps to take:

1. Make sure that you have created a private and public ssh key (without Passphrase).
2. On your Server in the folder ~/.ssh/, create a file, if it does not exist already `authorized_keys`.
3. Paste your public key contents there. Alternatively you could run:
   ```sh
   ssh-copy-id -i ~/path/to/yourPrivateKey yourServerUser@yourServerHost
   ```
4. Add the contents of your Private Key to your Projects Repository Secrets as `DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY`.

### üß™ CONFIGURATION

In your `.github/workflows` folder create a new file, e.g. `deploy.yml` and add the following content:

```yaml
  - name: Deployment
    uses: mai-space/action-typo3-deployment/@main
    with:
      sshPrivateKey: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY }}
      remoteUsername: 'your-ssh-user'
      remoteHost: 'your.host.server'
      remotePath: '/path/to/your/typo3-root'
      baseUrl: 'https://www.your-url.dev'
      typo3Context: 'YOUR_CONTEXT/YOUR_HOSTER'
      additionalFileStorages: 'fileadmin,fileadmin2,...'
      sshPort: 22
      phpVersion: '8.2'
      composerBinPath: '/bin'
```
